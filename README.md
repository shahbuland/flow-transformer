# Rectified Flow Architecture Search

This repository is my attempt to do an extensive sweep of different hparams, archs, etc. to see how things effect training for a rectified flow transformer model. I won't be training very long and will mainly just report large differences in loss. This isn't ideal a lot of the time but is useful when optimizing for speed or figuring out where things should go.
